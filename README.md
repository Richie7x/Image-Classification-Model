# Image-Classification-Model
Image Classification Model using ML and DS.

This project is created using python and it's powerful set of libraries. It uses Support Vector Machine algorithm to establish the ML model which predicta fairly accurate output after being rigoursly trained. 


Librares and tools used:
1. ipython-autotime  -----------------------Displaying execution time in ipython
2. bing image downloader  ------------------Webscraping images from bing
3. os library  -----------------------------Working with directories and folders
4. matplotlib  -----------------------------Plotting image data
5. scikit-learn  ---------------------------Implementing SVM model
6. pickle  ---------------------------------Saving ML model

NOTICE:
1. Model can be tested by loading an Image URL. *imread()* function from scikit-learn will read the image and the following code will produce an accurate prediction. (If the image from the web can't be accessible or is not authorized to access then the program will throw an error).
2. The repository has an archive containing test images which can be used as well.
